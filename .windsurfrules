## Technology Stack & Implementation:
- Evaluate and choose technologies that are both state-of-the-art and widely adopted for this type of functionality.   
- For each chosen technology, consult official documentation, best-practices, and well-established examples.  
- Document and follow the intended usage patterns and standard practices to ensure that implementations are professional and not “hacky.”
- Adopt a modular design that ensures clear separation of concerns.  
- Avoid overengineering by tailoring the complexity to the project’s scale (e.g., do not introduce heavy scaling frameworks if the app is for a single user).

## Development Process:
- **Incremental Feature Development:**  
  - Implement features in clearly defined phases or steps.  
  - Validate each phase with its own set of tests before moving to the next.
  - Write unit tests (using frameworks such as PyTest) and end-to-end tests before or alongside feature implementation.  
- **Bug Fixing & Refactoring:**  
  - When bugs occur, fix them in a targeted manner that preserves the established design and usage patterns.  
  - If a bug fix requires multiple steps or causes cascading issues, pause to review and possibly refactor the affected architecture to simplify and consolidate.
  - Consider interdependencies to ensure that changes in one part of the system are reflected appropriately in all affected modules.

## Quality Assurance: 
- Run all tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) after each phase and before merging any branch.  
- Ensure that the application starts and runs without errors.
- Document each change, including rationale and links to relevant sections of official docs or best-practice guides.  
- Don't deviate from the researched, intended use of a technology.
- Maintain a disciplined approach where the “right way” is always prioritized over quick-and-dirty fixes.
