Here’s a suggested backend structure for your local LLM chat application that supports prompt templates:

Backend Structure

The backend can be structured into the following components:

API Server (Flask):

Handles communication with the frontend.
Exposes API endpoints for:
Getting a list of available prompt templates.
Sending user messages and receiving LLM responses.
Retrieving chat history.
LLM Invocation Module:

Contains the logic to interact with the LLM (using Langchain and Gemini in your case).
Responsible for:
Loading and applying prompt templates.
Invoking the LLM with the formatted prompt and chat history.
Handling LLM responses.
Prompt Template Manager:

Manages the loading and retrieval of prompt templates.
Responsible for:
Reading prompt templates from storage (e.g., file system).
Storing prompt templates in memory for easy access.
Providing a list of available template names to the API server.
Data Persistence (SQLite Database):

Handles the storage and retrieval of chat history.
Uses SQLite for local file-based database storage.
You could potentially extend this to store prompt templates in the database as well, but for simplicity and user-friendliness of template installation, storing templates as files is often preferred.
Configuration Manager (Optional):

Manages configuration settings for the application.
Could store settings like:
Path to the prompt templates directory.
Database file path.
LLM model settings (if configurable).
API keys.
For a simple local app, configuration can be managed through environment variables or a simple configuration file.
Data Flow

Startup:

When the backend starts, the Prompt Template Manager loads all prompt templates from a designated directory (e.g., a folder named prompt_templates in the application directory). It stores these templates in memory, perhaps in a dictionary where the key is the template name and the value is the template content.
The API Server initializes and loads chat history from the SQLite Database using the Data Persistence module.
Frontend Request for Prompt Templates:

The frontend sends a request to the /prompt_templates endpoint of the API Server.
The API Server calls the Prompt Template Manager to get a list of available template names.
The Prompt Template Manager returns a list of template names.
The API Server sends this list back to the frontend as a JSON response.
User Sends Message:

The user selects a prompt template in the frontend and sends a message.
The frontend sends a request to the /chat endpoint of the API Server, including the user message and the selected prompt template name.
The API Server receives the message and template name.
The API Server calls the Prompt Template Manager to retrieve the content of the selected prompt template.
The API Server then uses the LLM Invocation Module:
It formats the retrieved prompt template with the user's message (and potentially chat history or other context if needed).
It invokes the LLM with the formatted prompt and the current chat history.
It receives the LLM response.
It updates the chat history in memory and saves it to the SQLite Database using the Data Persistence module.
The API Server sends the LLM response back to the frontend as a JSON response.

└── .env            (Environment variables - for API key)


How to Install Prompt Templates (for the User):

Users simply need to create new text files (e.g., my_template.txt) in the prompt_templates directory.
Each text file should contain a prompt template string, using placeholders like {user_message}.
The filename (without the .txt extension) will be the name of the template that appears in the frontend.
Example Prompt Template File (prompt_templates/summarize.txt):

Summarize the following user message:

User Message: {user_message}

Summary:
Frontend Considerations:

Template List: When the frontend loads, it should fetch the list of template names from the /prompt_templates endpoint and display them in a dropdown or list for the user to choose from.
Sending Template Choice: When the user sends a message, the frontend should include the selected template name in the JSON payload sent to the /chat endpoint.
This structure provides a good starting point for a local LLM chat application with prompt template support. You can expand upon this by adding features like:

Template Editing in the Frontend: Allow users to create and modify prompt templates directly through the frontend interface.
Template Categories/Tags: Organize templates into categories for easier Browse.
More Complex Template Formats: Use JSON or YAML for templates to include metadata and more structured prompts.
Configuration File: Use a configuration file (e.g., .ini, .yaml) for application settings instead of hardcoding paths.
