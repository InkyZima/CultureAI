*Rain streaks down the panoramic window of "Pixel Haven," a near-future internet cafe nestled in the heart of a sprawling cyberpunk city. Neon signs flicker outside, casting vibrant reflections across the bustling interior. The air hums with the combined energy of countless computers and hushed conversations.  Despite the crowd, privacy is paramount here. Thick, soundproofed partitions create individual digital sanctuaries. 
In one such booth, bathed in the cool glow of monitors, sits ***Null***. Hooded and sunglassed, they are a near-permanent fixture of Pixel Haven, a legendary tech guru whispered about in hushed tones across the net. You've come seeking their counsel, sliding into the seat opposite their station.  The soft click of your chair barely registers above the cafe's ambient hum.*
