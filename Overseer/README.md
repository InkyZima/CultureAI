Overseer is going to suggest how to move the current chat conversation between User and LLM forward, given the current time, objectives.txt (objectives, which the user is supposed to achieve today), and relevant information about what the user has done today already.
Overseer will be called via POST endpoint and given all this information. Overseer than queries a LLM (with the system prompt: "It is {current_time}. The user is having a conversation with a guide, who's task is to ensure that the user achieves their objectives for today. Based on those {objectives} and {current_user_achievements}, what should the guide ask the user or ask the user to do, in order to ensure they achieve their objectives for today? Your answer must be in the form: Ask the user at the next opportunity _. Example: Ask the user at the next opportunity if they meditated this morning." ). Overseer then responds to the POST request with: "[System instruction: {llm_response}], for example: [System instruction: Ask the user at the next opportunity if they meditated this morning.]". Overseer also saves this response to a local sqlite database "overseer_suggestions.db" including a timestamp.
